                <p class="summary">he webpage from CERN discusses the invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he was working at CERN. It was created to facilitate automated information sharing among scientists globally. The first website, hosted on Berners-Lee's NeXT computer, focused on the web project itself. CERN made the web software public on April 30, 1993, enabling its widespread adoption. The page also features links to the first website, a recreation of the initial web browser, and the first accessible web browser launched in 1992.</p>

                <p class="summary">The "Lost Cities of Geo" episode from 99% Invisible explores the rise and fall of GeoCities, an early web hosting service founded by David Bohnett and John Rezner in the 1990s. They created a virtual neighborhood concept to help users understand the internet by making it feel like a physical place where people could build their own websites. GeoCities allowed users to create themed communities but eventually faced challenges after being acquired by Yahoo!, leading to dissatisfaction among users regarding content ownership. The episode reflects on how GeoCities shaped online identity and community before its decline.
