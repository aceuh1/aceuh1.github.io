  <p>In the digital accessibility training I learned about ways to make websites accessible to all types of users and standard procedures of websites. The training made me re-think how content is structured on websites and also how to organize information in a digestible way for all for all types of information. I learned that when making a website that these things be included from the start to streamline the process and be fully inclusive, and that these benchmarks in general make websites better for everyone.  </p>
