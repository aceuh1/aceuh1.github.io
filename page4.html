    <h1>Reflections:</h1>
    <h2> Web Accesibility Training</h2>
  <p>In the digital accessibility training I learned about ways to make websites accessible to all types of users and standard procedures of websites. The training made me re-think how content is structured on websites and also how to organize information in a digestible way for all for all types of information. I learned that when making a website that these things be included from the start to streamline the process and be fully inclusive, and that these benchmarks in general make websites better for everyone.  </p>

    
<h2>In class activity: Email exchange with someone from 1995</h2>
<p> Internet society and culture has changed in a lot of way since 1995. Instead of having computer rooms or labs most people have a mobile device or mini computer (laptop) that can also access the internet. There is a lot more entertainment on the internet and also a lot of digitalized information. Renting movies by the disk or buying video games is almost completely virtual. Everyone uses the internet to access and even pay for many things, having and spending cash is becoming less used. A lot of things that you would have to go in person to figure out an be done from home like going to the bank. A lot of people share their lives through the internet with each other through social media where you can create or consume entertainment from, and not just people too even businesses/franchises have social media accounts up and running. The internet became a way to mass spread information across the globe almost instantly and has grown enough to the point where its part of daily life. </p>
